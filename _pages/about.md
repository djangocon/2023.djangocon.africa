<!-- DjangoCon Africa will be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia for the first time ever and is expected to host over 300+ attendees from all over the world! -->

## About the Conference
DjangoCon Africa will include 3 days of single-track talks, 1 day of workshops and sprints, and another day for touring for international visitors. 

The conference will feature talks about the Django Web Framework, related technologies and community. Be it an Entry level, Intermediate or Advanced developer, DjangoCon Africa has something in stock for everyone.

To make the conference as inclusive as possible, the event will offer financial aid to members of under-represented communities in software to ensure they can also attend. 

The CFP, which is open to all, will also be announced as soon as key details are in place.

## Schedule
DjangoCon Africa will run from the **9th - 13th November 2020**. The event will have three days of talks from the 9th - 11th November, one day of workshops on the 12th and an international tour day on the 13th November 2020.

## Django Girls at DjangoCon Africa
Will there be a Django Girls workshop at DjangoCon Africa? 

Of course there will be one! We are organising Django Girls Addis Ababa which will be held the weekend right before DjangoCon Africa. 

Django Girls Addis Ababa will be held from the 7th - 8th November 2020 at the American Centre, Addis Ababa. We scheduled it before the conference to enable the attendees to attend DjangoCon Africa talks and sprints after attending the workshop and being introduced to Python and Django.
