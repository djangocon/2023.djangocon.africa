## About the Conference
DjangoCon Africa will include 3 days of single-track talks, 1 day of workshops and sprints, and another day for touring for international visitors. 

The conference will feature talks about the Django Web Framework, related technologies and community. Whether you are an entry level, intermediate or advanced developer, DjangoCon Africa has something in store for you.

To make the conference as inclusive as possible, the event will offer financial aid to members of under-represented communities in software to ensure they can also attend. 

The CFP, which is open to all, will also be announced as soon as key details are in place.

## Schedule

- 6 November: Orientation and tour day - the participants can get to know one another while also exploring the city
- 7 - 9 November: Talks 
- 10 - 11 November: Workshops

## Django Girls at DjangoCon Africa

Will there be a Django Girls workshop at DjangoCon Africa? 

Of course, there will be one! We are organizing Django Girls Zanzibar which will be held the weekend right before DjangoCon Africa. 

Django Girls Zanzibar will be held on the 4th of November 2023. We scheduled it before the conference to enable the attendees to attend DjangoCon Africa talks and sprints after attending the workshop and being introduced to Python and Django.
