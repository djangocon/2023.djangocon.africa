## Proposing for DjangoCon Africa
# Selection process
We’ll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we think will make for the most enjoyable and engaging programme for our attendees. Volunteers from the Django community will be invited to help us select talks that will be interesting and useful to our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and together decide which talks to accept.

We are looking for original and exciting talks that can benefit the diverse interests of our audience.

If you’re a first-time attendee - don’t worry! We would love to be remembered as the conference where you started your speaking career.

<div class="conference-information" >
## Pre-conference information
You will have the option of uploading a rough transcript of your presentation about two weeks before the conference to allow the captioning team to train on any jargon used in your presentation. This is by no means required, but it will provide a more accessible experience for your audience.

The organizing team reserves the right to request a review of the draft slides at any point up to the start of the conference for any reason, including but not limited to content, message quality, and more. Failure to provide these slides in a timely manner may result in your removal from the program. We understand that the slides are draft quality and will not be shared outside of the programme and code of conduct teams.
