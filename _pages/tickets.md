**Student**: Students of any age, and you must be a student at the time of the conference to be eligible for this ticket type.

**Individual**: Individuals who are paying for their own ticket, or who are being sponsored by their employer.

**Business**: Companies with more than 5 employees. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able.


## What is the refund policy?

We will refund tickets up to 30 days before the conference. Which attracts a cancellation fee. After that, we will not be able to refund tickets.
