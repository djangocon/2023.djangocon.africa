# Information and advice for visitors
{: .h1}

One of the reasons for choosing Zanzibar as our location is that it is a very accessible part of the continent for international travel.


## The basics
Zanzibar, a province of Tanzania, is a cluster of islands in the Indian Ocean. DjangoCon Africa is being held on Zanzibar's main island, about 25km off the coast, known as Zanzibar Island or Unguja, and sometimes simply referred to as Zanzibar.

Zanzibar is a very popular tourist destination, receiving about 400 thousand visitors each year.


## Getting to Zanzibar

Zanzibar has its own international airport ([Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, IATA code ZNZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeid_Amani_Karume_International_Airport)), with direct connections to many destinations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Many direct flights to and from Zanzibar also include a stop in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city ([Julius Nyerere International Airport, IATA code DAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeid_Amani_Karume_International_Airport)).

It's also possible to fly to Dar es Salaam (Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, IATA code: ZNZ), and take a regional flight to Zanzibar. It's only a very short hop, and another option is to travel to the island by ferry (about two and a half hours).

[Expert Africa's flights to Zanzibar page](https://www.expertafrica.com/zanzibar/info/flights-to-zanzibar) includes some further useful basic information about travel.


## Visas

Visitors from most countries will require a visa. This can be obtained at the airport on arrival, but the queues can be long, and payment is required in hard currency cash. *It's strongly recommended to get an electronic visa in advance.*

See the [official Tanzanian government guidelines](https://visa.immigration.go.tz/guidelines) for more information, including list of countries whose nationals **must** obtain a visa in advance, and those whose nationals do not require a visa at all.

## Health, vaccinations and precautions

*All travellers should ensure that they have adequate health insurance for the trip.*

If you are travelling from a country where Yellow Fever is endemic, you must have a certificate of vaccination. Proof of COVID vaccination is not required, but you are strongly recommended to be fully vaccinated, for your protection and for the protection of others.

**Malaria precautions are advised.** Seek medical advice on whether you should be taking anti-malarial medication.

## Climate

In November, you can expect temperatures between 22 and 30˚C. The "short rains" season starts in November. It will be fairly humid. Be prepared!

## Appropriate dress

Zanzibar is used to receiving for visitors from all over the world, but it’s courteous to be mindful of local customs and expectations.

Zanzibar has a fairly conservative Muslim culture. **For both men and women**, clothing that covers the shoulders and knees (or at least the upper legs) is appropriate and expected. It would be insensitive to wear skimpy shorts or short skirts, or garments that display your midriff. This is particularly important in smaller towns and villages.

On the beach, it’s fine to wear swimming gear (bikini, etc) - but that’s for the beach only.

**For the conference itself**, please adhere to a smart casual dress code.

## Guide books

Bradt's [*Zanzibar* (2022)](https://www.bradtguides.com/product/zanzibar-10/), available in paperback or as an ebook, is recommended.
