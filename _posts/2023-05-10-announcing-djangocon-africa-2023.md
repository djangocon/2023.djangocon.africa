The African Django community is excited to announce the first DjangoCon Africa event, taking place this year in **Zanzibar, Tanzania**, from **6th - 11th November 2023**. The first event since the global pandemic postponed our planning in 2020. We are thrilled to convene, support one another and give back to the African Python web community now that travel and health safety guidelines have normalized. 
<!--more-->
DjangoCon Africa 2023 will be held at **the State University of Zanzibar** where we have three meeting rooms, one auditorium, 15 minutes away from food and activities, and convenient access to students, professionals, and international travelers. 
## About DjangoCon Africa
DjangoCon Africa will include 3 days of single-track talks, 2 days of workshops and sprints, and one day of touring for international visitors. <br>

The event will also include a Django Girls workshop to be held the weekend before DjangoCon Africa. To make the conference as inclusive as possible, the event will offer financial aid to members of under-represented communities in software to ensure they can also attend.<br>

The CFP, which is open to all, will also be announced as soon as the **month of June**.

## Sponsorship
The success of DjangoCon Africa lies hugely in the sponsorship of organizations and individuals within the Python/Django community. We are appealing to organizations and individuals to help us make DjangoCon Africa possible by sponsoring the event.

## About Tanzania
<img class="post-img" src="/static/img/site/zam.webp" alt="post-image" />

Tanzania is a country in East Africa widely known for its vast wilderness areas which include the Serengeti National Park and the Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa‚Äôs highest mountain, Kilimanjaro. Its offshore islands are Zanzibar, which has Arabic influences, and Mafia which is a marine park home to whale sharks and coral reefs.

Tanzania is also home to the world‚Äôs largest volcanic crater, the Ngorongoro Crater, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
For this reason, Tanzania is a great tourist destination, with many direct flights to Zanzibar (our host city) and Dar es Salam (the capital city). This means there are vast hotels and places to stay in Zanzibar and so many tourist activities to do outside the continents for all the visitors. English is widely spoken in Tanzania, which makes it easy for tourists to navigate the place.

We are so excited to host our first DjangoCon in Zanzibar and we hope to see you all there!
